# These are managed remotely by Terraform Cloud, but good to ignore any local remnants
**/*.tfstate
**/*.tfstate.*

# Terraform plan files (binary output of a plan)
# These are local and should not be committed
*.tfplan

# Local override files (often used for temporary local settings)
# If you use files like `terraform.tfvars.override` for local testing
